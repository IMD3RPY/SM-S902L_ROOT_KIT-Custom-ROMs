# SM-S902L_ROOT_KIT-Custom-ROMs

  Yes...I have done it, I have made a kit for rooting the StraightTalk Galaxy S5.
  Four bricked phones and a whole lot of frustration later here is the kit.
  
  To install roms you must first flash G900V_OE1_Stock_Rooted_Rom, and then flash
  any custom rom that you can name for the Verizon variant of the S5. (SM-G900V)
  For eample I use CyanogenMod 14 (Which is no longer available) on my phone.
  
    If you are new to the whole rooting thing please see guide one and if you
    have been a super user before, the go ahead and do your thing.
