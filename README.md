# SM-S902L_ROOT_KIT-Custom-ROMs

  Yes...I have done it, I have made a kit for rooting the StraightTalk Galaxy S5.
  Four bricked phones and a whole lot of frustration later here is the kit.
  
  To install roms you must first flash G900V_OE1_Stock_Rooted_Rom, and then flash
  any custom rom that you can name for the Verizon variant of the S5. (SM-G900V)
  For eample I use CyanogenMod 14 (Which is no longer available) on my phone.
  
  If you are new to the whole rooting thing please see the file titled guide, and if you
  have been a super user before, the go ahead and do your thing.
